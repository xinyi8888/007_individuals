From 2021 the local authority breakdowns for Northern Ireland derived from the Annual Population Survey no longer represent the official well-being statistics used by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, as these have been changed to the Northern Ireland Continuous Household Survey.",,,,,,
"5. Comparisons between areas must be done with caution as these estimates are provided from a sample survey. As such, confidence intervals are produced to present the sampling variability which should be taken into account when assessing differences between areas as true differences may not exist. ",,,,,,
"6. The colour coding reflects an estimate's co-efficient of variation (CV), which indicates the quality of a figure; the smaller the CV value, the higher the quality. ",,,,,,
